# Text-Based-Blackjack
Text-based blackjack with nifty ASCII graphics ;)
## Why?
I stumbled across ASCII box-drawing characters one day and started playing around with them. The second thing I made was a full deck of playing cards, then I figured that I could use them to make a Blackjack game for my computer science class, in which I was studying linked-lists.
## Programming
This Blackjack game was made in C++ using some of the standard libraries. The main focus of this exercise was to practice using linked lists. At the time of publication, the game does not have any memory leaks (that valgrind detected during testing).
## Use
